# MIT RACECAR Repository Copy #

This area of the repo is reserved for direct copies of mit-racecar github repos that we have used to advance the MIT RACECAR project.

GitHub Link: [MIT RACECAR](https://github.com/mit-racecar/)

All the pre-written code written by the MIT 6.141 class.  This is here as a copy for everyone to play with and hack at.  This repository only contains the sub-repositories that were useful to this project.

* hardware: all the 3D printing templates for the MIT RACECAR and the configuration files (.xml) for the VESC.

* racecar: respository that has control scripts for the MIT RACECAR.

* racecar-simulator: as stated.

* vesc: contains drivers and software to make the VESC work with the MIT RACECAR.


## hardware ##

This repository contains all the 3D printing templates for the MIT RACECAR and the configuration files (.xml) for the VESC.

GitHub Link: [MIT/hardware](https://github.com/mit-racecar/hardware)

```
git clone https://github.com/mit-racecar/hardware.git
```

## racecar ##

The respository that has control scripts for the MIT RACECAR.  This includes the teloperation and joystick controller.

GitHub Link: [MIT/racecar](https://github.com/mit-racecar/racecar)

```
git clone https://github.com/mit-racecar/racecar.git
```

## racecar-simulator ##

We have not looked at his yet, but it appears to be a simulator or substitute to driving the car during the training phase.

GitHub Link: [MIT/racecar-simulator](https://github.com/mit-racecar/racecar-simulator)

```
git clone https://github.com/mit-racecar/racecar-simulator.git
```

## vesc ##

This contains drivers and software to make the VESC work with the MIT RACECAR.  It also includes some code that interacts with the ROS.

GitHub Link: [MIT/vesc](https://github.com/mit-racecar/vesc)

```
git clone https://github.com/mit-racecar/vesc.git
```

## install_tools ##

This contains information about how to set up the Jetson TX1.  Since we use a TX2, this repository is not used at the moment.  There is room to improve it.

GitHub Link: [MIT/install_tools](https://github.com/mit-racecar/install_tools)

```
git clone https://github.com/mit-racecar/install_tools.git
